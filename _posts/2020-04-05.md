This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Goals
------
- [x] Try to find a way to utilize the LevelSequencer more variably. For instance, I want to bind my character and the enemy in an action
game, but both of them are not instanced yet.
- [x] Preview the footage in the sequencer, so I can edit it in real-time.
- [ ] Implement this system for all skeleton/classes.

Practice
------
1. Create an empty “Level” and “Level Sequencer”. The level is for preview purposes only.
2. Edit the sequence ---- animations, camera tweaks and both “attacker” and “receiver” character in the test level.

  * Tweak the spring arm here is easy, since it has a relative rotation mode. But when the sweeping is executed (in “iaido animation”), I want the “Attacker” can sweep/teleport forward 5 meters. So I have to implement a function in the character class, e.g:

3. Create an instance of this sequencer.

  * I want to disable my camera-controller within the sequence duration.
  * Re-bind “Attacker” and “Receiver”.
4. Play

Outcomes
------
1. How to implement the sequence within the big project is a problem.
2. Preview/Edit the sequence might break the setup of the level. The events here must have “Call in Editor” toggled on,
otherwise, you can’t preview that. On the other hand, if the events modify character classes, or instances in the test level, you have to carefully reset it back.
